The primary objective of this project was to prepare and analyse the total customer spending across the four different malls. The data preparation process was conducted using KNIME :computer:, which included merging four datasets into a single unified dataset, detecting and correcting errors in the dataset, transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis, and saving the final cleansed dataset.

This repository provides detailed documentation of the steps undertaken during the data wrangling process and the rationale behind each step. It also outlines the challenges encountered during the process and the lessons learned from these experiences. :bulb:
